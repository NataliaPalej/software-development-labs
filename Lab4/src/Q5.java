		/*Create a new class called “Wk4_sem2_q5”, select the “public static void main (String [] args)” option.	
		Write a method that is passed an array, x, of doubles and an integer rotation amount, n. 
		The method creates a new array with the items of x moved forward by n positions. Elements that are rotated off the array
		will appear at the end. For example, suppose x contains the following items in sequence:
		1 2 3 4 5 6 7
		After rotating by 3, the elements in the new array will appear in this sequence:
		5 6 7 1 2 3 4
		Array x should be left unchanged by this method. Use the following code to help you get started. 
		Be sure to test your program with different rotation amounts.*/
